# rubber-duck
a webrtc client who's always down to chat

This is very much a WIP. Nothing to see here for now. 

The goal is to implement a webrtc client that can talk to (and exchange media with) instances of itself in a browser (WASM) and a server (Go). From there probably lots of experimentation with webrtc APIs, specs and protocols.

# Run:

- cd ./js/app/ && yarn build 
- go run .
- Navigate to http://localhost:8080/
